# Responsive-Web-Design
In this Responsive Web Design Certification, I will learn the languages that developers use to build webpages:
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.
First, I will build a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. 
Later, I will learn modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin,
and best practices for accessibility by building a web form.  
Finally, I will learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a Twitter card with Flexbox, 
and a complex blog layout with CSS Grid.
